# Data Vizualization Final Project
Visualizing Musical Emotion with Data
Tools & Platforms: Observable, D3, JavaScript, Kaggle Spotify Dataset


# Project Overview
This project explores the emotional landscape of popular music from 2000 to 2019 using data visualization as both an analytical and interpretive medium. Drawing from Spotifyâ€™s Top Hits dataset, which includes quantitative features such as valence, energy, tempo, and danceability, the goal was to translate these algorithmic metrics into visual forms that reflect the complexity and subjectivity of musical emotion. Rather than simply charting data, this work asks: How can we visualize what music "feels-like" just what it measures?
