# Data Vizualization Final Project
Visualizing Musical Emotion with Data

Tools & Platforms: Observable, D3, JavaScript, Kaggle Spotify Dataset


# Project Overview
This project explores the emotional landscape of popular music from 2000 to 2019 using data visualization as both an analytical and interpretive medium. Drawing from Spotify’s Top Hits dataset, which includes quantitative features such as valence, energy, tempo, and danceability, the goal was to translate these algorithmic metrics into visual forms that reflect the complexity and subjectivity of musical emotion. Rather than simply charting data, this work asks: How can we visualize what music "feels-like" not just what it quantitatively measures?


**Static Visualization**
- The Emotional Spiral: A radial timeline that visualizes the evolving emotional patterns in Billboard’s top hits from 2000 to 2019.  
  - Valence: mapped to color (from melancholy blue to joyful yellow)  
  - Energy: mapped to radial distance from center  
  - Tempo: used to size the data points  
  - Year: drives spiral progression  
- Visual argument: energy has increased in pop music over time, with emotional clustering around specific cultural moments.
